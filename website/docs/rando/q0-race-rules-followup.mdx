## Advanced hint applications

## Ruleset reasoning

There are a lot of things which are pretty standard at this point which do not need to change:
beating 3 dungeons to get Hyrule Castle access, leaving out Palace of Twilight, starting with Shadow Crystal, etc.

I will skip talking about these things which everyone already agrees on.

### Design philosophy

- Seed times should not be too long.
  It should be feasible for people to hold impromptu races on weeknights.
  If seeds are lengthy for the best players, then seeds will be unreasonably lengthy for brand new players, and this harms the growth of the racing scene.
- It should be easy for new players to start racing, but we don't need to sacrifice depth or the skill ceiling to do this.
- Seeds should have a good amount of variability so that each seed is a unique experience.
- There should be many viable ways to approach a seed, and there should be room for player expression and creativity.
  Optimal play should involve players to reacting to new information rather than executing on a single best approach.
  Players should not be synced for the first 15 minutes.
  Options should be left open for the player so that they have the freedom to make decisions that differ from other players.
- Players should ideally have a plan most of the time, and we should reduce how much of the seed that players spend "in a casino".
- Go-mode should be short so that players do not have to spend much time "going through the motions".
  Seeds are more exciting to play and watch when things are still up in the air.

### Starting items

#### Hawkeye

The Hawkeye is basically the equivalent of the Wind Waker's Telescope.
It somewhat surprisingly can be used in several places to save time, and there is plenty of room for people experiment with the item.
It will only get more useful once Chest Appearance Matches Contents is implemented.

#### Two Goron Mines Key Shards

This makes it so that you need to find 1 Goron Mines big key like all of the other dungeons.
When you have to find 3 big keys for Goron Mines, it is basically always the last dungeon you complete.

#### Three Hyrule Castle Small Keys

This effectively enables Small Keysy for Hyrule Castle.
We do this because having to search for keys in Hyrule Castle every seed quickly becomes a chore.
We still want to find the Hyrule Castle Big Key (which you can think of like Light Arrows in OoT).
Like the Light Arrows, you can get a hint on where to find the big key once you have access to the end of the game (for TP, once you can enter Hyrule Castle).

### Excluded checks

#### Bulblin Camp

#### Post-dungeon checks

#### Jovani

### Agitha

### Fast spinner

Fast spinner is not turned on because it makes optimal play pretty dumb.
If you think it does not have that much of an impact, then you are not abusing it enough.
Epona-like speeds in almost every room in the game is incredibly strong.

I would potentially enable it if we were able to limit it to the following areas:

- areas where you can already ride Epona
- Gerudo Desert.
  This area is kind of a slog, so having it be different some of the time is welcome.
- possibly Lake Hylia if people wanted it since launching out from Falbi is funny.
  Other than that, I don't agree with it in Lake Hylia though.

It is possible that it might still be too strong with those changes, but an option to limit it to those areas would make me consider it.

As an aside, I think some people might think Epona invalidates Fast Spinner, but in reality skipping having to call Epona is significant.
Calling Epona is only better over distances which are likely longer than you would ever go in a race without warping.

### Big Keysanity

I find that in general I am having more fun in a seed when I have some sort of direction/plan to my actions, and this is part of why hints are so good.
They provide info which lets people use their brain to make informed decisions rather than simply chase density.

Think about how it feels to play a seed with no hints vs a seed with hints.
I think everyone would agree that the hints are an improvement.

To me, the most boring parts of a seed are the following:

- when I am in a "casino" for an item. In TP it is usually a sword casino for your 3rd sword.
- when it's time to go to the desert / running through the desert
- once I am in go-mode

I think this is because these are extended periods of time where there is no real thought or decision-making involved.

#### What is bad about Own Dungeon big keys?

Own Dungeon big keys don't actually ask anything of the player (at least in TP).
They artificially extend the duration of the dungeon, but I do not think there is any real thought involved.

Think about when you are not in go-mode and are clearing a dungeon.
Does anything about how you play the dungeon change before and after you have found the key?

On the other hand when you are in go-mode, things are much worse.
Completing 80+% of a dungeon when you already have everything you need to beat the game is not fun.
Personally, I would rather be starting a new seed than going through the motions in a solved seed.

#### What is good about Big Keysanity?

So if big keys in their own dungeon don't actually add anything to the game (or make it worse), what if we changed the big keys to where they _do_ add something to the game.

Enter Big Keysanity:

- Big Keysanity turns finding the big keys into mini-goals that you need to achieve, and the big key hints help guide your routing decisions.
- The presence of big key hints will cause different players to take different actions.
  Some people may like to dip dungeons early while others may prefer to wait and hope they find the big key on their own.
- Hints in dungeons (including big key hints) give more of a reason to dip dungeons early.
  I think a seed is more fun when it is a mixture of dungeons and overworld, and the big key hints can make it less appealing to save all dungeons for the end.
- Having a big key in its own dungeon becomes a somewhat interesting occurrence ("hey, I've seen this one") rather than a constant.
- TP does not actually have that many important items that the player has to find (especially compared to OoT), and Big Keysanity helps with this.
- Whenever you see a big key in the world, there is some excitement to figure out which one it is.
- Randomly finding a big key you need is nice.

Here is an example play that I think is pretty cool:

- Use Ooccoo to warp out of Goron Mines once you find the big key hint and finish checking the dungeon.
  Once you find the key, you dip into City in the Sky to do some of those checks and get its hints.
  Then you use Ooccoo to warp back to Goron Mines from CitS which lets you avoid paying the time cost of exiting the dungeon that you would normally pay if you were to dip CitS from a neutral state.

I would agree that Big Keysanity does not make sense before hints, but we are no longer in a pre-hint world, so it makes sense to question things.
I encourage you to try this setting out, because I believe it makes the game more fun.

### Small keys in own dungeon

I am definitely a fan of keysy, but I have swapped back to having small keys for a few reasons:

- added an option to prevent small keys from appearing on bosses.
  This improves small keys in multiple ways which I go over later.
- I had been focusing on dungeons which are made worse by keys or for which the keys don't really add anything (Goron Mines and Temple of Time).
  However, I do think that Snowpeak Ruins is more interesting with small keys, and I am open to the idea of key counting to skip checks.
- Forcing a small key in the first chest of Temple of Time and Arbiter's Grounds is preferable.
  If you don't do this, then each of these dungeons has a lone check at the start which is separated from the rest of the dungeon.
  This opens you up for some pretty crappy seeds when either of these checks is important.
- I acknowledge that this setting is more popular, and since I see more merit in it now, I don't want this to be a point of contention that turns people away from trying these race rules.

The main downside is that dungeons are slightly nerfed when looking at percentages, but it is not the end of the world.
People can hold a tournament where you have to find 3 Skybooks, so things could definitely be worse!

### No small keys on bosses

When small keys are set to Own Dungeon, you should never be forced to beat a dungeon's boss to get a small key to access the rest of the dungeon.
When this happens, you get warped out of the dungeon and then you have to reenter and retread a bunch of ground which is not enjoyable.
For example, if the last small key is on Fyrus, then it is impossible to full clear the dungeon without reentering it after you beat it.
Preventing small keys on bosses prevents this from happening.

Another benefit is that the main Temple of Time dungeon is always locked behind Lantern (even with Big Keysanity).
This makes it easy to understand when the dungeon opens up to you, and it also reduces the number of checks which can contain the Lantern.
This is good since the Lantern is (to quote someone) "a bit of a problem item".
There are a huge number of checks which are hard-locked behind Lantern, and a lot of them are one-off checks in zones that you might otherwise clear in a single pass.
The large number of isolated Lantern checks makes finding it late into a seed pretty painful, so reducing the chance of this happening is a good thing.

It also makes counting keys easier and more useful.
If small keys are never on the boss, then you can say "I have X checks left on the dungeon map and I am missing X keys, therefore all remaining checks are keys and I can safely skip them".
When you have to factor the boss heart container into this, it not only becomes more confusing, but it is also less likely that you will be able to make this play.

In my opinion, no small keys on bosses is more intuitive, helpful, and enjoyable, and I am of the opinion that it should be the default behavior.

_(I realize that there are some situations where it is not possible to full clear a dungeon before beating the boss, but small keys should not be designed to make this more likely. For example, Clawshot on Fyrus Heart Container and 2nd Clawshot is locked behind the first. It is therefore not possible to do the Goron Mines clawshot check before beating the dungeon. This is a single check though rather than an entire branch of the dungeon, and this is also much less likely to happen.)_
