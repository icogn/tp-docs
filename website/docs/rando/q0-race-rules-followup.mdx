## Ruleset reasoning

There are a lot of things which are pretty standard at this point which do not need to change:
beating 3 dungeons to get Hyrule Castle access, leaving out Palace of Twilight, starting with Shadow Crystal, etc.

I will skip talking about these things which everyone already agrees on.

### Starting items

#### Hawkeye

The Hawkeye is basically the equivalent of the Wind Waker's Telescope.
It somewhat surprisingly can be used in several different places to save time, and this list of places will only get larger as people experiment with the item.
It will only get more useful once Chest Appearance Matches Contents is implemented.

#### Two Goron Mines Key Shards

This makes it to where to you only need to find 1 Goron Mines big key like all of the other dungeons.
If you need to find 3 big keys for Goron Mines, then it is basically always the last dungeon you complete.

#### Three Hyrule Castle Small Keys

This effectively enables Small Keysy for Hyrule Castle only.<br/>
We still want to find the Hyrule Castle Big Key (which you can think of like Light Arrows in OoT).

### Excluded checks

#### Bulblin Camp

#### Post-dungeon checks

#### Jovani

### Agitha

### Fast spinner

### Dungeon entrances

### Big keysanity

### No small keys on bosses
