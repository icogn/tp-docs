# Hints

Hints help direct the player in the correct direction as they complete a seed.

Hints as a feature are still being developed in a fork.
When development is completed for the first iteration of the feature, hints will be available for a seed on its seed page.
Eventually, you will have the option to discover hints through gameplay (but that will not be here anytime soon).
The hints on the seed page will continue to be an available option even once the gameplay hints are working.

## Hint Zones

Every check in the game is assigned to exactly one Hint Zone.
For example, "Wrestling With Bo" belongs to the "Ordon" hint zone.

---

:::note

The hints are meant to answer the question “Should I go to this place?”.
That being the case, checks which are initiated in one place and which end in another are classified by where you go to start the check.
This means:

- Plumm is considered a Lake Hylia check
- Iza checks are considered Upper Zora’s River checks
- Goron Springwater Rush check is a Kakariko Village check

:::

Most of the hint zones are self-explanatory, but I would like to point out a few things:

- `Kakariko Village` and `Kakariko Graveyard` are separate hint zones.
- `Faron Woods` includes all Faron Province overworld checks which are not in `Faron Field` (including the caves).
- Areas which would be considered "Hyrule Field" are split into the following zones:
  - Faron Field
  - Kakariko Gorge
  - S Eldin Field (middle of the bridge and south; includes the bug on the bridge and the owl statue chest)
  - N Eldin Field (middle of the bridge and north; owl statue sky character, stalfos grotto, lava cave, and one bug)
  - Lanayru Field (does NOT include the west part of Outside Castle Town; includes the Spinner check)
  - Outside Castle Town (includes the west, east, and south parts)
  - Great Bridge of Hylia
- Since the desert is so large, it has been split into two zones:
  - Upper Desert
    - The part of the desert where you land when entering from Lake Hylia
  - Lower Desert
    - The part of the desert after the portal area which you reach by jumping down a level.
      This includes the grotto with 2 poes, and it continues all the way up to the Arbiter's Grounds entrance.

## Hint Types

There are currently 5 types of hints:

`Spirit of Light`, `Barren`, `Always`, `Sometimes`, and `AgithaRewards`

### Spirit of Light

Spirit of Light hints (or SpoL hints for short) indicate a hint zone which contains a specific check which is 100% required to logically complete the seed.

For example, if you are playing a glitchless logic seed and one of the SpoL zones is Ordon, you would not be able to logically complete the seed if you were to leave Ordon without doing any checks and never go back.

If `Ordon` is SpoL, Spinner might be on `Wrestling with Bo` for example.
You could also have something a little more complex like a Male Mantis in `Ordon` and a Clawshot from the Male Mantis reward.

:::note

SpoL hints will never refer to a check already covered by an Always hint.
So if the Jovani 20 Poes check is hinted to be Clawshot and Castle Town is SpoL, then there must be another required check in Castle Town which is not Jovani.

:::

### Barren

Barren hints indicate a hint zone for which all of its checks contain unimportant items such as rupees and ammo refills.

:::note

It is technically possible that a Barren hint zone is required, but the chance is incredibly low.
Hidden Skills do not prevent a hint zone from being hinted barren, so it is possible for all 7 hidden skills to be in Lake Lantern Cave which is hinted Barren.
You need at least 1 hidden skill to finish the game, so in this case you would have to visit Lake Lantern Cave despite it being hinted Barren.
Again, the chance of this is so low it might as well not exist, but I wanted to mention it.

:::

### Always

Always hints tell you the rewards for a list of checks.
For all seeds you do, you will always be told what these checks have, hence the name.

For example, you will always be told the rewards for the following checks in the Sunday race settings:

- Goron Springwater Rush
- Iza Helping Hand
- Jovani 20 Poe Soul Reward
- Lanayru Ice Block Puzzle Cave Chest

These checks are some of the worst in the game, and people almost always do them only after they have exhausted all of their other options.

Always hints really shine when they hint things that may or may not be required, such as a Bomb Bag or a Bug when Agitha has required stuff.

### Sometimes

Sometimes hints are like Always hints in that they tell you the rewards given by certain checks.

The difference is that Always hints are always selected, but Sometimes hints are randomly selected from a pool.
So a specific Sometimes hint will only be selected some of the time.
The exact Sometimes hint pool will vary depending on settings.

These checks are usually time-consuming ones which are not so bad they deserve to be Always hints.

:::note

Zones not already covered by SpoL and Barren hints are prioritized when picking Sometimes hints.

:::

### AgithaRewards

The AgithaRewards hint tells you every interesting item Agitha can give out as a reward.

## How hints are calculated

Hints are generated in the following order:

1.  Always
1.  AgithaRewards
1.  Spirit of Light
1.  Barren
1.  Sometimes

- The only one which really matters is that Sometimes is calculated after Spirit of Light and Barren.
- Barren is done after SpoL so that it can filter out the SpoL zones up front (though this is just an optimization which isn't strictly necessary).
- Spirit of Light needs to know which checks are used for Always hints, but this list is known before the Always hints are created, so Always hints could technically be done last.

:::note

Every hint references a specific check even if the exact check is unimportant (such as with Barren hints).

:::

### Always

These are extremely straightforward.
Generate a hint for each "Always check".

### AgithaRewards

Determine what constitutes an "interesting item":

- Start with a generous pool of items
  - Includes items such as Shields and Magic Armor since they are nice to know, but they likely don't decide whether or not you completely ignore Agitha for the seed.
  - Exact list: `Progressive_Sword, Progressive_Wallet, Ordon_Shield, Hylian_Shield, Zora_Armor, Magic_Armor, Shadow_Crystal, Boomerang, Lantern, Slingshot, Progressive_Fishing_Rod, Iron_Boots, Progressive_Bow, Filled_Bomb_Bag, Progressive_Clawshot, Aurus_Memo, Asheis_Sketch, Spinner, Ball_and_Chain, Progressive_Dominion_Rod, Progressive_Sky_Book, Renados_Letter, Invoice, Wooden_Statue, Ilias_Charm, Horse_Call, Gate_Keys`
- Add any items which show up in the Spheres.
- Add any bugs for which their Agitha reward is not excluded or vanilla.
- Remove Hidden Skills and Poe Souls since they are not that helpful and they make the hints harder to read.

Loop through all Agitha rewards:

- if the reward is an "interesting item", add a hint to the list for that check.

Sort the hint list alphabetically so players can't try to infer anything about which bugs matter based on the order.

### Spirit of Light

At a high level:

- get a list of checks which could be hinted as SpoL
- convert this list to a list of hint zones
- randomly sort the hint zone list
- select zones from the front of the list until you reach the desired number or you run through the entire list
- for each selected zone, randomly select a SpoL check in that zone, then create a hint for that check

Determining which checks can be hinted as SpoL:

- Iterate through the spheres.
  For each check in the spheres, add it to a list of potential SpoL checks if the following are all true:
  - Does not contain an "invalidSpolItem"
  - check is not already covered by Always hints
  - check's hint zone is not Agitha if the AgithaRewards hint is on
- Iterate through the new list of potential SpoL checks:
  - For each check, replace its contents with a green rupee.
    If the seed is still beatable when that check's reward is replaced with a green rupee, that check cannot be hinted SpoL.
- return the new list of checks which are definitely required

The "invalidSpolItems" list is static:

- Poe Souls
- Hidden Skill
- Progressive_Sky_Book
- Fused Shadows and Mirror Shards
- All Big Keys, Small Keys, Dungeon Maps, Compasses, Cheese, and Pumpkin

### Barren

A zone cannot be hinted barren if any of the following are true:

- it is already hinted SpoL
- it is Death Mountain
- it is Agitha if the AgithaRewards hint is on
- it is an unrequired dungeon when the "Unrequired Dungeons Are Barren" setting is on
- 100% of the checks in the zone are excluded or vanilla

Creating the list of potential barren zones:

- Filter the list of zones which pass the above checks, the randomly sort the filtered list.
- Iterate through the list, selecting zones which pass the following:
  - none of the checks in that zone have "preventBarrenItems" as their reward
- We stop iterating through the list once the desired number of hints is reach or the list is exhausted (whichever happens first).

Calculating "preventBarrenItems":

- These items always prevent barren:
  - Progressive_Sword
  - Boomerang
  - Lantern
  - Slingshot
  - Progressive_Fishing_Rod
  - Iron_Boots
  - Progressive_Bow
  - Filled_Bomb_Bag
  - Progressive_Clawshot
  - Aurus_Memo
  - Spinner
  - Ball_and_Chain
  - Progressive_Dominion_Rod
- For all singleCheckItems (golden bugs and Ashei's Sketch):
  - Add the bug or Sketch to the preventBarrenItems if the reward for the item is not excluded.
- Add all items which show up in spheres
- Remove Hidden Skills, Poe Souls, Mirror Shards, and Fused Shadows
- If the BigKey setting is not Anywhere or AnyDungeon, remove all big keys.
- If the SmallKey setting is not Anywhere or AnyDungeon, remove all small keys.

### Sometimes

- Generate a list of potential checks based on settings.
  - For example, the Death Sword check can only be hinted if "Unrequired Dungeons are Barren" is off or if Arbiter's Grounds is a required dungeon.
- Iterate through the checks and split them into 2 lists:
  - One list is for checks in zones already covered by SpoL and Barren hints.
  - the other checks go in the other list
- Randomly sort each list
- Concat the 2 lists, putting the list of checks not in zones covered by SpoL and Barren first.
- Starting at the front of the list, create a hint for each check until we reach the desired number of hints or run out of entries in the list.

## Simulated Hints

### General

The new `Simulate in-game hints` option helps test out ideas for in-game hints.

Instead of seeing all of the hints on the seed page after generation, you will see a list of locations.
You can only reveal the hints for each location once you fulfill its condition (which is usually standing in a specific place).

:::note

When you try to reveal a hint on the seed page, it will tell you the conditions and show you a picture of the location.
You don't have to memorize all locations before the race and operate purely from memory.
Just know that there is one Hint Spot for most Hint Zones and you should be okay.

:::

#### Midna

Midna's hints represent the text that would display you when you talk to Midna.
For the simulated hints, you can reveal the Midna hints as soon as the timer starts.

For example, Midna might say:

```
Required dungeons:
{Forest Temple}, {Goron Mines}, {Snowpeak Ruins}

The {Spirits of Light} guide the hero chosen by the gods to {Outside Castle Town}.

They say that there is {nothing} to be found in {Kakariko Graveyard}.
```

This would be three text boxes.
The first tells you the required dungeons (which will be useful once the Random Starting Point feature has been added).
The second text box is a SpoL hint, and the third text box is a Barren hint.

#### AgithaRewards

The `AgithaRewards` hint represents the text that would be on the sign outside Agitha's Castle in the game.
For the simulated hints, you can reveal the AgithaRewards when you are standing outside Agitha's Castle.

An example of Agitha's text would be:

```
Please bring the {12} golden bugs to Princess Agitha's ball.

I have {GREAT happiness} to share with benefactors of the insect kingdom:

{Female_Ant}, {Iron_Boots}, {Male_Grasshopper}
```

In this case, there are three text boxes.
The first tells you how many bugs have not had their Agitha Reward excluded, meaning you will be able to trade in this many bugs.
The second text box indicates that Agitha has interesting items.
The third text box tells you the interesting items she can give out (this is just the `AgithaRewards` hint you see when not simulating in-game hints).

If there was nothing on Agitha, you would only get the following two text boxes for example:

```
Please bring the {12} golden bugs to Princess Agitha's ball.

I will share my {happiness} with benefactors of the insect kingdom.
```

There is no list of items and the happiness is not GREAT, so you can know that Agitha is not required for that seed.

#### General Hint Spot

A General Hint Spot represents a "sign" that would exist in the game.
"Reading the sign" would show you two text boxes (give two different hints).

_**There is one `Hint Spot` per `Hint Zone`, except for following Hint Zones**_:

- Dungeons
- Cave of Ordeals
- Agitha
  - Rather than a "sign" at a location which gives the basic 2 hints, the Agitha hints have special text which reveals all of the useful Agitha rewards, so the hint for this is not grouped in the General category.
- Hero's Spirit
  - No shared physical location in the world to put a Hint Spot for this zone

---

For example, in the website you would see a `Lanayru Field` row which says:

```
Lanayru Field     On middle of bridge
```

To view the hints for this location, you will stand in the given location and click `Reveal Hints` to see the hints.
The website will display an image of the location on the popup so it is easier to find the correct location to stand.

The text for this might be:

```
They say that there is {nothing} to be found in {Kakariko Graveyard}.

They say that {Zoras Domain Light All Torches Chest} has {Arrows_10}.
```

The text that displays for all hints is meant to represent the list of text boxes you would see in the actual game once the feature gets implemented there.

All of the general "sign" hint spots scattered around the world (one per Hint Zone for most zones) will have 2 different hints on them.

:::note

While testing simulated in-game hints in the website, it is okay to simply pass over the hint spot and reveal it later when it is more convenient to interact with the website (such as while warping somewhere).

:::

### How hints are assigned to Hint Spots

Start from the base hint distribution:

For the `isaac` simulated hints, there are 2 SpoL, 2 Barren, 4 Always, and the AgithaRewards hint is on.

The first SpoL and Barren are given to the special Midna hint spot, and the AgithaRewards are given to the special AgithaRewards hint spot.

The remaining hints are 1 SpoL, 1 Barren, and 4 Always.

#### Assigning hints to spots

There are 23 total scattered hint spots.
Based on settings, the Hidden Village hint spot will get junk.
This means there are effectively 22 signs scattered around the world which have 2 hints each (or 1 hint if the sign is junked).

Any signs which are in hinted barren areas will get a single junk hint, which serves a few purposes:

- If you are visiting an area and the sign gives you a junk hint, you know that you should go somewhere else.
  This helps with getting unlucky with where you decide to go early game.
- If you know an area is hinted barren, then you have no reason to visit it.
- It is possible to randomly come across junk hints during seeds which can be funny and catch you off guard.

Since there are 2 hinted barrren areas with these settings, that leaves 20 scattered hint spots, meaning we need to assign 40 hints to signs.
The number by no means must be exactly 40 -- it just happens to be this many currently with these settings.

Assigning hints to signs:

- First we create a three copies of the above hints, so instead of 6 (1 SpoL + 1 Barren + 4 Always), we will have 18.
- The remaining 22 hints will be filled in with Sometimes hints which are added in 2 copies at a time.
- The hints are spread out so that signs should get at most a single SpoL, Barren, or Always hint, and a sign will never have the same hint twice.

:::note

It is possibly for slight variations in the hints based on how things were randomly generated, but in general the above is true.
For example, it is possible for 0 or 1 Hint Zone to be Barren in which case the hints will be different.
Also it is possible to get a single copy of a Sometimes hint based on how the hint spots were randomized during generation, but there will almost always be 2 copies of a Sometimes hint.
