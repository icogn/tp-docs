## Hints

Hints are technically new to Twilight Princess Randomizer, and in-game hints are especially new.
Additionally there are some new capabilities with the TPR Hint System which <span style={{"text-decoration": "underline"}}>do not exist in other Zelda Randomizers</span>.
Therefore it will take a little time to really develop an understanding, even if you are already familiar with hints in other Zelda Randomizers.

Remember that learning how to route and extract as much info as possible from each hint is a skill which cannot be perfected on your first playthrough.
You will likely have an easier time understanding the hints by playing through a few seeds.
It is not recommended that you attempt to develop a perfect understanding before playing.

It is recommended that you watch/skim the <Link to="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ihj2hD4ElM&list=PLSyD19UZrem_r1Xmgb0Pu7dk_1v80X_HY&index=1">Hint System Introduction Video</Link> (2x speed recommended) to learn where all of the hint signs are located.
Then you should casually play through a few seeds to get a better feel for things.

To understand almost everything there is to know about this ruleset and hint distribution (including a deep dive into the guiding principles), please see the <Link to="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WfROEovmZ0&list=PLSyD19UZrem_r1Xmgb0Pu7dk_1v80X_HY&index=2">Detailed Ruleset Explanation Video</Link>.

The linked videos are also part of a playlist where I (Isaac) play through some seeds with these settings, so you may want to watch through those to get a better understanding of what these seeds look like from the perspective of an experienced player.

## Approaching a seed

Here is a general outline of how you might approach a seed:

- Check the Ordon sign in front of you to get your starting hints.
  - This sign will ALWAYS indicate whether or not Ordon is hinted barren.
  - If a zone's sign does not have a hint indicating "my zone is barren", then that zone is NOT hinted barren.
    This is an absolute that applies to ALL zones!
    - If a sign has a Junk hint such as "Go on, lad. Open the chest. (barren zone)", then it is telling you the zone you are currently in is hinted barren, and you should evacuate the area!
  - If you are clearing Ordon right away, you should hold off on doing Bo or Goats since exactly one of these is guaranteed to be a Sometimes hint.
- Check the required dungeons on Link's house sign.
- The next priority is completing sphere0 checks and gathering hints.
  - Do not forget that you can warp to different provinces from the start.
  - You may want to prioritize going to a zone which was hinted as Path by a starting hint.
  - While you are still determining the other 2 zones which are hinted barren, checking the hint sign in a zone should be one of the first things you do there (to confirm if it is hinted-barren or not).
    - In total, there are 3 hinted-barren zones; 1 of the 3 is a starting hint.
    - A zone's sign will _ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS_ indicate whether or not that zone is hinted barren (even for dungeons).
  - Note that if you get a Sometimes hint for a check in Zone A, then you know that Zone A is not hinted barren.
    You can potentially use this to decide where to go next.
- As part of your sphere0 routing, you may want to gather 4 poe souls.
  You will need to find 5 poe souls for the Jovani reward, but 1 is always right next to Jovani.
  However, if Castle Town is hinted barren then the Jovani reward is junk.
  - Jovani's reward is NOT hinted since you only need to find a few poe souls.
- If you find a hint such as "bringing male/female bugs to Agitha leads to nothing", then you know that Agitha is not barren.
  At some point you will want to go check the sign outside Agitha's Castle to see all Good items she rewards.
  (Agitha is her own zone. She is NOT part of the Castle Town zone. However, she IS part of Lanayru Province.)
  - She may still have Good items even if you do not see this hint!
    You should always check at some point (early or late is up to you).
- You will likely find some of the Big Keys you need randomly.
  To help with the ones you don't find, every dungeon's sign will hint the area containing its Big Key (including Hyrule Castle).
- Don't forget that these are excluded: Shop Items, Bulblin Camp, Death Mountain

Everything else should be mostly self-explanatory.
Good luck!

## Hint distribution

:::tip
You are probably ready to try a seed out just from reading the "Approaching a seed" section.
You can always come back to this section later.

On the other hand, for an in-depth explanation of absolutely everything you would ever need to know, please see the videos linked at the top of the document.
:::

The hint distribution is set to the "Blossom" distribution.

Hints can be found in-game by reading signs spread across the overworld and dungeons.
You can find one sign per zone, and excluded zones and unrequired dungeons do not contain hints.
Also the sign outside Agitha's Castle has the AgithaRewards hint.

:::note

There are rare edge cases to almost everything when it comes to hints (such as 0 barren zones meaning 0 Barren hints).
I don't list these here since it would make it more difficult to understand, and they are (1) rare and (2) not critical to know before playing.

:::

### Overworld signs

In general, each Overworld hint sign contains 2 hints (with the 2nd hint being a Sometimes hint), and each hint appears on 2 different signs.
Signs with Always hints do not have Sometimes hints; they contain 2 Location hints for Always checks instead.

Furthermore, the Ordon sign is a special "starting hints" sign which contains your 4 starting hints:

- 1 Barren hint
- 1 Path hint
- 1 "major / first layer" hint
- 1 "minor / second layer" hint

For normal Overworld signs, the following can be found as the first hint on the sign:

- 2 Path hints
  - Ex: "They say that {Eldin Field} is on the path to {Morpheel}."
  - Note that Path hints with BigKeysanity are generated as if you start with all big keys.
    See the linked videos for the explanation.
- 2 Barren hints
  - Ex: "They say that there is nothing to be found at {Lake Hylia}."
- 3 "major / first layer" hints (more on this later)
- If needed, Item hints for junk items fill leftover space.
  - Ex: "They say that a {Red Rupee} can be found at {Kakariko Graveyard}."

**Always hints**

- 5 Always hints (2 checks hinted per sign; find at least 3 and at most 4 of the 5 signs to get all hints)
  - Ex: "They say that {Goron Springwater Rush} rewards {bombs (5)} (not required). They say that {Iza Helping Hand} rewards an {orange Rupee} (not required)."
  - Note that there is no "2nd layer hint" after the 2 Always hints on a sign.

Always Checks:

```
- Goron Springwater Rush
- Iza Helping Hand
- Lake Hylia Shell Blade Grotto Chest
- Lanayru Ice Block Puzzle Cave Chest
- Plumm Fruit Balloon Minigame
```

**"Major / First Layer" Hints**

The first hint on the sign is the stronger hint.
The second hint is usually just a Sometimes hint.

You should expect to see these every seed:

- MostSwordsProvince hint
  - This tells which province contains the most swords.
    If the number is 2, then it is possible that 2 provinces both have 2 swords.
  - Ex: "They say that {2 swords} can be found in {Dungeons}."
  - Ex: "They say that {3 swords} can be found in {Lanayru Province}."
  - Ex: "They say that {1 sword} can be found in {Peak Province}."
- ItemToItemPath hint
  - Indicates that you must find at least 1 copy of an item in order to logically find the 2nd item.
  - The 2nd item is always a unique (one findable copy) item which is logically required to complete the seed.
    This implies that the first item is also logically required.
  - The Items referenced by this hint are never rewards for checks targeted by other hints.
    See the linked videos for more details.
  - Ex: "They say that a {Clawshot} is on the path to the {Lantern}."
  - Ex: "They say that a {Dominion Rod} is on the path to the {Male Grasshopper}."

You should expect to see 2 of the following 3 hint types every seed:

- TradeGroup hint
  - Ex: "They say that bringing {male bugs} to Agitha leads to nothing."
  - Indicates that either male or female bugs can be ignored.
  - This hint can only appear for seeds in which Agitha is not skippable.
  - Note that bugs only prevent barren if they lead to an item which prevents barren, so it is unlikely you will find all 8 bugs.
    This is because some of the bugs which lead to nothing will likely be in barren zones.
- Item hint
  - This hint is specifically set up to only ever direct toward checks with a "Required" CheckStatus, and this is indicated in the hint text as well.
  - The hinted area is a Province for unique items and a Zone for items with multiple copies.
    However if the Province is 'Dungeons', then it will hint the exact dungeon.
  - Ex: "They say that a {Dominion Rod} (required) can be found in {Faron Woods}."
  - Ex: "They say that the {Gale Boomerang} (required) can be found in {Lanayru Province}."
  - Ex: "They say that the {Lantern} (required) can be found in {Goron Mines}."
- BarrenCategory hint
  - Indicates that a group of checks are barren.
  - For a full explanation of the HintCategories, please see the Detailed Ruleset Explanation Video at the top of the document.
  - Ex: "They say that there is nothing to be found in {Grottos}."
  - Ex: "They say that there is nothing to be found in the {Lower Desert}."
  - Ex: "They say that there is nothing to be found in the {Lake Lantern Cave lantern chests}."

#### Second Layer / Sometimes hints

The 2nd hint on an Overworld sign is usually a Sometimes hint.

Some Overworld signs do not have 2nd layer hint placed on them:

- a sign with Always hints
- a sign belonging to a hinted-barren zone
  - Note that there is no reason to go to an Overworld zone once you already know that it is hinted barren.

Sometimes hints are picked from a pool of somewhat time-consuming or inconvenient checks, but there are a few special cases which take priority over the normal pool.

- Sword Item hint
  - There will be one Item hint for a check which rewards a Progressive_Sword which does not belong to the "MostSwordsProvince".
  - Ex: 2 swords are in Eldin Province, 1 in Ordona Province, and 1 in Desert Province.
    You might get a hint like "They say that a {sword} can be found in the {Gerudo Desert}.".
- Bo or Goats hint
  - Exactly one of "Wrestling With Bo" or "Herding Goats Reward" will always be hinted (unless Ordon is hinted barren).
  - This is to encourage coming back for these checks later to make the start of the seed more fun.
  - Ex: "They say that {Wrestling With Bo} rewards a {purple Rupee}."
- City in The Sky West Wing First Chest
  - When CitS is a required dungeon, there is a 50% chance that this Sometimes hint is included.
  - This is to encourage doing the west wing of CitS forwards some of the time and backwards some of the time.
  - Ex: "They say that {City in The Sky West Wing First Chest} rewards {Arrows 10}."
- Boss Heart Container WotH hints
  - Whenever a boss heart container has a "Required" CheckStatus, there is a 50% chance that it is hinted (max 1 per seed).
  - This is meant to be an "oh snap" moment that only shows up very rarely.
  - Ex: "They say that {Snowpeak Ruins Blizzeta Heart Container} is on the way of the hero."

The rest of the Sometimes hints come from a pool.
A decent number of these hints are lantern checks which are off by themselves in order to lessen the impact of finding Lantern late into the seed.
Others are checks which are slow or inconvenient such as "STAR Prize 2" and "Ordon Cat Rescue".

### Special hints

#### AgithaRewards hint

- The Agitha sign is located right outside of Agitha's Castle, and it hints all Good items which are rewarded from Agitha.
  - The only exception is that bugs which Agitha gives you are never listed even if they would be considered Good because this can make the hint harder to read.
    Thus, it is important that you trade in any bug which you receive from Agitha (unless you already know that gender of bug leads to nothing).
- In the event that Agitha rewards no Good items, her hint sign will indicate this.
  Otherwise it will indicate which items she can reward.
  - Ex: "Spinner"
  - Ex: "Bow, Bow, Sword"

#### Big key hints

Since Big Keysanity is on and big keys can be nearly anywhere, each dungeon's hint sign indicates where you can find its big key.

Normally you will get an Item hint for the zone containing the big key.
When the big key is on a trade reward, you will instead get a TradeChain hint toward the check that starts the chain ending in the big key.

- Ex: "They say that the {Forest Temple Big Key} can be found in {North Eldin}."
- Ex: "They say that the {â™€ grasshopper} in {Lanayru Field} leads to the {City in the Sky big key}."
- Ex: "They say that the {Hyrule Castle Big Key} can be found at {Lake Hylia}."

Big Keysanity adds more items to find and gives you some direction and mini-goals to achieve.
You will likely find some of the big keys randomly as well.
You may want to dip a dungeon early to get its hint, or you may want to see if you get lucky without the hint.
The choice is yours!
For an in-depth explanation for why this ruleset uses BigKeysanity, please see the Detailed Ruleset Explanation Video linked at the top.

#### BeyondThisPoint hints

Certain zones have a BeyondThisPoint hint which will be one of the following:

- {Nothing} beyond this point!
  - Any checks beyond this point are barren.
- {Something good} can be found beyond this point.
  - There is at least one Good check beyond this point.

You do not need to memorize where these hints are since the hints are fairly self-explananatory when you find them, but these are the places you can find them:

- Lake Lantern Cave
  - Hints the status of the 2nd half of the cave.
- Snowpeak Sign
  - When Snowpeak Ruins is not a required dungeon, the Snowpeak sign will hint the status of the Freezard Grotto and the Cave Ice Lantern Chest.
- Goron Mines
  - Hints the status of the rest of the dungeon starting at the 2nd elder room.
- Lakebed Temple
  - Hints the status of the west wing of the dungeon.
- Arbiter's Grounds
  - Hints the status of the checks beyond the poe gate.
- Temple of Time special 2nd sign
  - Hints the status of the 2nd half of the dungeon.
  - This is a special 2nd sign which is after the first half of the moving walls room.
    The main ToT sign is near the start of the dungeon right before Ooccoo.
- City in the Sky
  - Hints the status of the east wing.

These add some variety to long (completely/mostly) linear sections or help with time-consuming checks.
For example, it is better to skip the 2nd half of LLC some of the time rather than do the exact same thing every single seed.

### Important hint tips

#### Hinted-barren zones hint themselves barren

- If a zone is hinted barren, then its hint sign will ALWAYS indicate that it is barren (even for dungeons).
  - If there are no other hints on that zone's sign, then it will use a Junk hint.
    - Ex: "Who need mirror? (barren zone)"
  - If there are other hints on that zone's sign, then it will use a Barren hint which indicates its own zone.
    - Ex: The Arbiter's Grounds sign includes the hint "They say that there is nothing to be found at {Arbiter's Grounds}."
- If a dungeon is hinted barren, it will hint itself barren in addition to the 2 Barren hints which exist on overworld signs.
  - For overworld zones which are hinted barren, one copy of the Barren hint goes to the hinted-barren zone and the other can go to any other overworld sign.
- There is no reason to visit an Overworld zone once you already know it is hinted barren.

:::tip
If you see a Junk hint, it is time to evacuate the area. You are in a barren zone!
