# Rando Race Rules

These are the rules for the standard races hosted by isaac (usually on Sunday).

The main goals of the rules and settings are the following:

- Pretty much anyone should be able to join and complete the seed.
- More experienced players should be able to complete most seeds in under 4 hours.
- "Bad seeds" should not be unreasonably time-consuming.
- Some number of tricks/glitches should be allowed so that people have things to learn and so that more experienced players do not become frustrated with the rules.

## General rules

- Using save states is banned.
- Using any sort of custom macros is banned.
- Using an emulator to pause the game's execution or advance frames is banned.

### Logic Rules

`Logic Rules` is set to `Glitchless` so that anyone who joins should be able to complete the seed.

### Access Options

Hyrule Castle and Palace of Twilight requirements are set to `Fused Shadows` for a couple of reasons:

- There will be exactly 3 required dungeons other than Hyrule Castle.
- Palace of Twilight will never be a required dungeon.
  This is good because currently Palace of Twilight requires you to complete Arbiter's Grounds to access it.

`Faron Woods Logic` is set to `Open` so players don't have to do Forest Temple every time.

### Item Pool

The item pool includes everything but Poes.
Poes are excluded because they add a significant number of checks which has a meaningful impact on the average and worst-case completion times.
Additionally, getting a random Poe Soul is not very satisfying.

Having hidden skills in the pool is nice because the chance you make it to the end and forget to get Ending Blow is very low.

Randomized bugs are nice because they are quick to check.

### Dungeon Items

Small Keys and Big Keys are set to `Own Dungeon` which has the following benefits:

- Spices the dungeon up a little compared to Vanilla key placement.
- "Double-dipping" a dungeon is less likely than with some of the other options.
- It is not as important that the player memorizes how many keys each dungeon has compared to some options.

`Maps and Compasses` is set to `Start With` for the following reasons:

- Players do not have to be as familiar with each dungeon since they start with the map and compass.
- Getting Maps and Compasses from chests plays the music to hype you up like you are getting something good which results in disappointment when you find out it is just a Map or Compass.

### Starting Inventory

Players start with `Shadow Crystal`, `Horse Call`, and `Gate Keys`.

- Shadow Crystal
  - Speeds up seeds significantly since you start with the ability to warp.
  - Starting the seed with a way to attack enemies is nice.
- Horse Call
  - Speeds things up and is convenient to have.
- Gate Keys
  - Opens up the seed more at the beginning.
    If you don't start with gate keys, the seeds pretty much all start out by going through Kakariko Village and finding Bombs.

### Excluded Checks

- Agitha Checks
  - Agitha checks are excluded since she can easily increase the number of spheres and backtracking resulting in longer completion times.
  - Full list: `Agitha Female Ant Reward, Agitha Female Beetle Reward, Agitha Female Butterfly Reward, Agitha Female Dayfly Reward, Agitha Female Dragonfly Reward, Agitha Female Grasshopper Reward, Agitha Female Ladybug Reward, Agitha Female Mantis Reward, Agitha Female Phasmid Reward, Agitha Female Pill Bug Reward, Agitha Female Snail Reward, Agitha Female Stag Beetle Reward, Agitha Male Ant Reward, Agitha Male Beetle Reward, Agitha Male Butterfly Reward, Agitha Male Dayfly Reward, Agitha Male Dragonfly Reward, Agitha Male Grasshopper Reward, Agitha Male Ladybug Reward, Agitha Male Mantis Reward, Agitha Male Phasmid Reward, Agitha Male Pill Bug Reward, Agitha Male Snail Reward, Agitha Male Stag Beetle Reward`
- Cave of Ordeals Great Fairy Reward
  - This single check would take a large number of items and a long time.
    If it was ever required for a seed, that would be a nightmare.
  - Full list: `Cave of Ordeals Great Fairy Reward`
- Golden Wolves
  - Skipping the Howling Stones and Golden Wolf Trainings saves a good amount of time.
  - Full list: `Faron Woods Golden Wolf, Gerudo Desert Golden Wolf, Kakariko Graveyard Golden Wolf, North Castle Town Golden Wolf, Ordon Spring Golden Wolf, Outside South Castle Town Golden Wolf, West Hyrule Field Golden Wolf`
- Hidden Village Checks
  - The Hidden Village checks are only relevant if ToT is required, so it can be easy to forget them.
  - The cat hide-and-seek minigame is time-consuming.
  - There were some bugs related to Impaz which may or may not have been fixed.
    Would hate for people to lose their run to a bug.
  - Full list: `Cats Hide and Seek Minigame, Skybook From Impaz`
- Iza 2
  - Iza 1 is already quite time-consuming.
    Iza 2 is like Iza 1 but easy to fail and have to restart.
  - If Iza 2 is actually required, chances are it is a "bad seed".
  - Full list: `Iza Raging Rapids Minigame`
- Jovani 20 Poe Soul Reward
  - Was removed by group decision.
  - Could maybe try it again once we can reduce the number to more like 10 poes.
  - Full list: `Jovani 20 Poe Soul Reward`
- Trade Quest Checks
  - The trade quest is hard to understand, and the seeds play perfectly fine without it.
    When and where is what available and how does ToT affect things?
    There is a lot to remember.
  - `Doctors Office Balcony Chest`

### "Other" Settings

- Timesavers are all on to save time.
- `Transform Anywhere`
  - Convenient and saves time.
- `Increase Wallet Capacity`
  - The default wallets are too small.
  - I think ideally I would have the wallet sizes at 500, 1000, and 2000 in a future update.
- `Shop Models Show The Replaced Item`
  - It would not improve the player's experience to turn this off.
  - I think the only reason this setting exists is because this was how it worked at one point before they got updating the models working.
- `Foolish Item / Ice Trap Frequency`
  - Turned off by group decision.
    It was not popular when it was on.
- `Dungeon Entrance Settings`
  - `Mines Does Not Require Wrestling`
    - The wrestling minigames are an RNG time sink, so this option is appreciated.
  - `Lakebed Does Not Require Water Bombs`
    - Rather than make people have to learn how to clip into Lakebed, we remove the need for clipping entirely.
  - `Arbiters Does Not Require Bulblin Camp`
    - Speeds things up.
    - There are bugs related to the camp key currently.
  - `Snowpeak Does Not Require Reekfish Scent`
    - Speeds things up.
    - I prefer that people search for useful item-wheel items rather than keys to get into places.
  - `Temple of Time Does Not Require Sword or Grove`
    - Saves time and gives the portal to Sacred Grove at the start which is nice.
  - `City Does Not Require Filled Skybook`
    - Sky Characters are the worst thing about this game.
    - Rather than searching for Sky Characters, I think it is more enjoyable to search for useful items.

## Glitches/Tricks

:::note

I use "glitch" and "trick" interchangeably.

:::

These rules take the approach of "a glitch is allowed until it proves itself to be problematic".

In general, a glitch is banned if it does one of the following:

- Goes against the spirit of the Randomizer by giving you a guaranteed item.
- Gives a significant time advantage.
- Reduces the item requirements to beat the seed.

A player can use glitches/tricks to speed up their playthrough, but they should still be ultimately "playing the same game" as a new player who hasn't learned a bunch of glitches/tricks.

:::warning

A glitch/trick which is banned is banned under all conditions.
For example, Double Clawshot Skips are banned even if you have Double Clawshots.
This probably won't be enforced if the race is casual, but keep in mind it is technically against the rules.

  - You gain control of Link on the title screen, and there is a lot of stuff that can happen from there.

### Hyrule Castle Double Clawshots Skips

- What is it:
  - There are two locations where you can skip the need for the Double Clawshots in Hyrule Castle.
    - In the big room where the lights turn on, you can stand on a ledge and do a precise clawshot target to continue to the next room with a single clawshot.
    - After using the 2nd small key, there is a part with broken stairs which is meant to require Double Clawshots.
      You can skip the Double Clawshots requirement by timing or mashing A such that you press A on a single frame which causes you to land on ground instead of falling into the void.
- Why is it banned:
  - Reduces the item requirements to beat the seed.

### Hyrule Castle Spinner Skips

- What is it:
  - There are some LJAs you can do on the Spinner portion of your climb to the final boss fight which skips needing to have the Spinner.
