### Selecting the default Quest Log

The default quest log on the file select screen is picked this way:

- From the set which includes Quest Log 1 and any other Quest Logs which pass their checksum test, pick the Quest Log which has the latest timestamp (compared at the seconds level).
- In the case of a tie, Quest Log 1 has the highest priority and Quest Log 3 has the lowest priority.

:::info

Quest Logs which fail their checksum test say "This Quest Log is corrupted."

### Naming

- The timestamp is passed to `OS::OSTicksToCalendarTime` which is where the term OSTicks comes from.
