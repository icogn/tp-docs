⚠️ The Quest Log section is in the early research stages.

Here are some references you can use instead:

This is really only public since it would be a pain to hide.

Naming:

- Everything will be assigned a unique identifier which should make sense in a vacuum.
- Explanations about the naming will be located on details pages for each section.
- The names are in no way meant to line up with the decomp variable names.

Notes:

- Custom within-page search at the top maybe. What was the idea behind this?
- Column which displays absolute address in RAM based on selected game version, and ability to use a custom address.
