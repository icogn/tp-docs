⚠️ The Quest Log section is in the early research stages.

Here are some references you can use instead:

_(This is really only public since it is easier than trying to hide it.)_

Naming:

- Everything will be assigned a unique identifier which should make sense in a vacuum.
- Explanations about the naming will be located on details pages for each section.
- The names are in no way meant to line up with the decomp variable names.

Notes:

- Custom within-page search at the top maybe. What was the idea behind this?
- Column which displays absolute address in RAM based on selected game version, and ability to use a custom address.

Row colors:

- Red means I haven't really looked into it.
- Purple means it still needs work/double-checking.
- Blue means the name is still being decided.
- No special color means I feel like I understand it pretty well (though the name can still change).

I recommend viewing this page in dark mode at the moment.
