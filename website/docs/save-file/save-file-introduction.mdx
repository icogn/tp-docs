# Save File Introduction

Discussion of the save file is broken into two main sections:

## Memory Card

- TP's data on the memory card at a high level.

Learn to read memory card `raw` and `gci` files.

## Quest Log

- Low level data such as small keys and quivers.

Learn things like:

- Where will I appear when I start this file?
- How do I modify my save data so I have X item?

And much more.
