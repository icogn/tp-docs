# PNG to BTI

import PngToCi8 from '@local/PngToCi8';

This page provides an easy way to convert PNGs to BTIs.

The motivation for this page was to allow people to create memory efficient icons and banners for GCI files, so it currently only generates BTIs with the following configuration:

- Image is CI8 format
- Palette is RGB5A3 format

:::caution

The image can have a maximum of 0x100 (256 decimal) different pixel colors (rgba values). If you have GIMP, you can select Image > Mode > Indexed.
Under "Colormap" in the popup, set the maximum number of colors to 256, then hit "Convert". Now you can export the file as a new PNG which will fit within the palette entry limit.
