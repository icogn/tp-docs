# PNG to BTI

import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';
import PngToCi8 from '@local/PngToCi8';

The goal of this page is to provide a way to create memory efficient icons and banners for GCI files, so it currently only generates BTIs with the following configuration:

- Image is CI8 format
- Palette is RGB5A3 format

There are other tools (such as <Link to="https://szs.wiimm.de/wimgt/">wimgt</Link>) which handle general image conversion, but they do not support BTI files with palettes.

**For a GCI file with a single icon and banner, you waste nearly half a block by not using a palette!**

:::caution

The image can have a maximum of 0x100 (256 decimal) different pixel colors (rgba values).
If your image's palette is too large, you can use GIMP to shrink it.
In GIMP, select Image > Mode > Indexed.
Under "Colormap" in the popup, set the maximum number of colors to 256, then hit "Convert". Now you can export the file as a new PNG which will fit within the palette entry limit.

## GCI Header

If you use files you generate here in a GCI file, make sure the header has the following values:

- Offset 0x07 (imageFlags, u8) - The least significant 2 bits are 0b01. The value will likely be either 0x01 or 0x05.
- Offset 0x30 (iconFormats, u16) - For a single icon, the value here should be 0x0001.

:::note

This section applies to the DirectoryEntry on a memory card as well (since this is what a GCI header is).
